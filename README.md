Purpose:

In this project, we aim to analyse and understand the reasons behind the increasing number of injuries in the English Premier League(Soccer) and possible solutions.

Method:

We first scrap data to show the increasing number of injuries in the Premier League over the last decade to observe since when there has been a large spike in injuries. 

Following this, we aim to understand possible reasons for the increasing number of injuries and use data to support our hypothesis.
